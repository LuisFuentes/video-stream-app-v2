Notes:
	For your installation location of crtmpserver:

	The location of the "mediaFolder" is located inside the crtmpserver folder under
	"crtmpserver/builders/cmake/crtmpserver/crtmpserver.lua". Inside this .lua file,
	the "mediaFolder" tag is inside the Sample FLV Playback tag. The "mediaFolder" tag
	is the reference directory location for all .FLV videos that can be accessed by
	crtmpserver.
	
	cd <install-directory/crtmpserver/builders/cmake/crtmpserver
	<open editor - gedit?> crtmpserver.lua
	//Find Sample FLV Playback tag and add:
		mediaFolder="<path_to_flv_files", //note the comma at the end
		
To Run:
	Open multiple tabs/windows for terminal

	1)Crtmpserver run:
	
	Go to directory - crtmpserver/builders/cmake/ then run this
	./crtmpserver/crtmpserver ./crtmpserver/crtmpserver.lua
	
	2)Python Flask run:
	Go to directory - video-stream-app/videoApp/flaskApp then run this
	python ./run.pc
	
	3)Open up firefox and visit "localhost:5000"
	
The App:
	Runs a web app that ultizies BootStrap2.3 interface and uses Flask to run the HTML
	index page. Upon opening the page location, Apache opens the Python web page (index.html)
	and connects the components of Flowplayer correctly. Flowplayer is a simple video player
	that can be placed inside a html page.
	Once a user has selected a video to stream from the drop down menu, the html page sends a
	request to the crtmpserver to access the video location of the video. The crtmpserver will then
	return the video and autoplay the chosen video to the user inside the HTML page dynamically.
